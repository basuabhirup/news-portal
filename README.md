# News Portal App

## How to Run this App ? 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
`git clone https://github.com/basuabhirup/news-portal.git`

2. Install all the required dependencies `npm install`

3. Set two environment variables `REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY`. You can either ping me to get these API keys directly from me, or else you can generate them by your own from https://newsapi.org/ and https://openweathermap.org/api respectively. 

**Note:** This is a mandatory step. If you don't set the correct API Keys, the app will not run properly.

4. Use the command `npm start` to run the app in your local machine.
